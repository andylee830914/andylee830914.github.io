In this talk, we will explore key concepts in modern cybersecurity, focusing on attack strategies, detection mechanisms, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI). We will explore foundational frameworks such as the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK, along with various attack modeling approaches essential for describing the attack. Our discussion will highlight the role of machine learning in enhancing malware detection and intrusion detection systems. Additionally, we will present our research on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for log analysis, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enrichment, and attack modeling. By leveraging these AI-driven methodologies, we demonstrate how cybersecurity is becoming more adaptive and intelligent, allowing for a more effective response to evolving threats.
