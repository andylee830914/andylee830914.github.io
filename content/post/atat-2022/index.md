## Abstract

In this talk, we investigate the numerical treatment of the Biot–Savart law and provide computation reliability for vortex filament evolution based on Rosenhead's regularized Biot–Savart law for incompressible fluid. We reproduce the numerical reconnection of vortex filaments by GPU computation and establish reliability based on numerical experiments. We measure the rounding error quantitatively by comparing the numerical solutions with quadruple precision and multiple-precision arithmetic. Our proposed GPU computation enables us to investigate the relation of temporal and spatial discretization parameters to mitigate disturbance in numerical solutions in reasonable computational time
