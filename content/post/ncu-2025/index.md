In this talk, we will explore how generative AI is reshaping modern cybersecurity, with a focus on attack strategies, detection mechanisms, and real-world applications. We will introduce key cybersecurity fundamentals and examine threat modeling through frameworks such as the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK. The discussion will highlight the expanding role of generative AI in today’s internet systems and its impact on defensive capabilities. We will also present our work using Large Language Models (LLMs) for log analysis, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enrichment, and attack modeling, demonstrating how GenAI-driven methods are making cybersecurity more adaptive and intelligent in countering evolving threats.
