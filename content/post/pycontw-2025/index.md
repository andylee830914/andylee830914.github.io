## Abstract

In the global tech community, language barriers often hinder knowledge exchange and sharing. As a local conference, PyCon Taiwan faces the challenge of attracting Pythonists from around the world and fostering meaningful interactions. This talk will review the technological advancements of PyCon TW from 2023 to 2025, covering topics such as video subtitles with Whisper, live translation, and the application of AI-powered notebooks. We will explore how these technologies have gradually improved the accessibility and interactivity of the conference.
