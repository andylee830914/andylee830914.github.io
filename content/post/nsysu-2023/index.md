## Abstract

In this work, we introduce a FreeFEM module that integrates Python with FreeFEM, enhancing the computational capabilities of this platform. With various Python packages developed by the community, performing tasks such as visualization within FreeFEM becomes straightforward. This integration is achieved through pybind11, which allows us to incorporate Python scripts into the FreeFEM dynamic loading module, primarily coded in C++. We will use plotly, a popular web visualization package in Python, as an example to demonstrate how to manipulate FreeFEM data using Python.
